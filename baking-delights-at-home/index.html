                    Baking at home is both an art and a science, offering endless opportunities to create sweet and savory treats. From decadent chocolate cakes to crusty artisan bread, baking allows you to experiment with textures and flavors. Understanding the basics, like accurate measuring and proper mixing techniques, is crucial for success. Even the smallest error, like miscalculating ingredients or overmixing, can alter the final product.
